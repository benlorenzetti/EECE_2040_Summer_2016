Dear Grader:
I love plain old C and am not convinced that object oriented programming
is worth it.
Then again, the whole object[<a href="#note1">1</a>] of this assignment is
learning OOP, so I have decided to use C in an objecty way and then observe
what advantages this offered and what advantages C++ would have offered.
</p>

<p>
C++ got started while Bjarne Stroustrup was working on "C with Classes",
so I think this is a very natural way to learn OOP and where its value lies.
As an example of some OO techniques I have used, I have parametric polymorphism
in a generic container library similar to the std::vector class in C++.
[<a href=#note2">2</a>]
Also I use subtype polymorphism with a union of several structs representing
different geometric objects. Finally I have ad-hoc polymorphism in an area()
function that works on several of the subtypes.
</p>

      Object, what an overloaded word in computer science, am I right?

    <li id="note3">
      Yet another overloaded word: vector; what if I want to store geometric vectors
      in a dynamic array?
